## Overview

Deepdesk is an enterprise-grade platform for creating, managing, and deploying AI agents. It empowers organizations to leverage advanced AI capabilities while maintaining complete control over their data and infrastructure.

## Purpose

Deepdesk addresses several key challenges in enterprise AI adoption:

- **Custom Agent Creation**: Build and manage AI agents tailored to specific enterprise use cases
- **Integrated Interaction**: Access a unified chat interface for engaging with AI agents and enterprise data sources
- **Simplified Integration**: Deploy custom AI agents without the complexity of managing multiple data source integrations
- **Security-First Design**: Maintain data privacy and security within your company's infrastructure

## Key Features

- üí¨ **Interactive Chat Interface**: Seamless communication with AI agents
- üîí **Private Data Integration**: Connect securely to enterprise data sources
- üîÑ **MCP Protocol Support**: Industry-standard Model Control Protocol for agent communication
- üîå **Flexible Model Integration**: Adapters for various LLM providers
- üè¢ **On-Premises LLM Support**: Run open-source LLMs within your company VPC
- üîì **Vendor Independence**: No vendor lock-in

## Architecture Principles

Inspired by [Anthropic's approach to building effective agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents), Deepdesk follows these core principles:

- **Simplicity**: Building the right system rather than the most sophisticated one
- **Transparency**: Making agent planning steps explicit and visible
- **Well-designed Tools**: Providing clear, well-documented interfaces between agents and systems
- **Standardized Communication**: Using MCP (Model Control Protocol) for consistent agent interactions
- **Modularity**: Adapter system for connecting to various LLM providers
- **Enterprise Security**: Infrastructure designed to keep business data within your control

## System Architecture

![System Architecture](images/archi.png)

The architecture consists of:

1. **User Interface Layer**: Intuitive UI with authentication and authorization
2. **MCP Host**: Core component with permissions management, interaction layer, MCP client, and configuration system
3. **LLM Engine**: Handles language processing tasks
4. **Enterprise Services**: Document, database, API and other enterprise service integrations

**Data Flow**:  
User ‚Üí UI ‚Üí MCP Host ‚Üí MCP Client ‚Üí Enterprise Services (via HTTP)  
LLM invocation occurs through the MCP Host.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 21+
- Maven (included via Maven Wrapper)
- Node.js with `npx` (for MCP server)
- Python 3.13.x with uv package manager (for MCP server)
- API keys as environment variables:

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key'
# optionally depending on your needs
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-anthropic-api-key'
export BRAVE_API_KEY="your-brave-api-key"
```

### Quick Start

```bash
# Run the application
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Build executable JAR
./mvnw clean package

# Run tests
./mvnw test
```

## Native Builds

Deepdesk supports native executable generation for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

```bash
# Linux/macOS
chmod +x build-native.sh
./build-native.sh

# Windows
build-native.bat
```

Native executables for all platforms are also available in GitHub Releases.

## Security & Privacy

- **Data Sovereignty**: Business data remains within your infrastructure
- **Private Deployment**: Support for local LLM hosting in private VPCs
- **Zero Data Leakage**: No external data transmission required with local models
